Search for strcpy
Looking back, you find move and lea, 
Looking even before that, you find: 
   0x00005555555549de <+36>:	mov    -0x58(%rbp),%rdx
   0x00005555555549e2 <+40>:	lea    -0x50(%rbp),%rax
Strcpy takes two arguments that are pointers, which is why you decide to use -50 

With buffers, 50 in hex is 16^1*(5)+ 16^0*(0) = 80, 
*fp rbp has 8 bytes
Therefore 'A'*88 will overflow the buffer
