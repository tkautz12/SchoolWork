My input was ./vuln_prog.bin 1111 < malicious_input1.txt. The ID I used was 1111. For this task I needed to access a static variable to set it to 26 so the if statement would return true. To do this I needed to exploit a format string vulnerability. To do this I printed many A's followed by many many "%p"s. The "%p"s returned the next addresses. I used the many A's to find out the position on the stack of the buffer I was printing to because I know that A in ascii is 41. I figured out that it took 44 %p's to get to the 41s. After that I found the memory address of the song variable I wanted to change at 0x6010ac. I knew I needed to use the %n call to write to song, so I put 26 A's before the %p call. after the %p call I put the address of song in the input. I ran into problems when I found 6010ac because there were other values infront of it so I needed to put trailing 0's with \x00\x00\x00\x00 so the address would be the only thing stored in that part of the buffer. I needed to push the address's location using 1 B, and I then updated 44 to 48 because the 26 A's and the 1 B pushed the address to 48. I then used the command %48$n to print the number 26 that the %n counted into the address for song. Once the code ran with my input it played Eminem instead of Ed Sheeran.
