./vuln_prog4.bin $(cat malicious_input4.txt) or ./vuln_prog4.bin $(printf "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\x39\x05") are the inputs I used to get "You win!" to appear. Since buf come right before magic, this exploit was a simple overflow. I filled buf with 16 A's to fill it. Then I needed to figure out how to set magic to 1337. I converted 1337 to hex and it came out to 539. I needed to put that in a form that the computer understands so it became \x39\x05. I put that after the 16 A's, I tested it, and it worked.
